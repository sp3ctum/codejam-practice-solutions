This repository includes code I use for practicing clojure. In this
repository I solve the google code jam practice problems

## Solutions

0. [Always turn left](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/32003/dashboard#s=p1),
   the labyrinth solver. In this problem I'm given a route through a
   labyrinth as "walk forward" or "turn left". The goal is to output
   the form of the labyrinth.
   The solution must be encoded in hexadecimal for google's checker,
   but I went ahead and created an interactive UI for it that can be
   used to draw different kinds of labyrinths.
